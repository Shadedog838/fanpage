                <p>Turf Wars Part Three, published on August 11, 2018, is the third and final installment of the Turf Wars trilogy.

When Asami is kidnapped, Korra will stop at nothing to find her... the only problem is, she's not entirely sure where she's been taken. The Avatar will have to make peace -- and a deal -- with a dangerous foe if she is to find her girlfriend alive. Meanwhile, Tokuga demands Asami assist him with a sinister plan, and unless she can think quick on her feet, thousands of Republic City's occupants will perish. The two women must trust in both themselves and each other if they are to survive. Their fate is revealed in this stunning, action-packed conclusion to The Legend of Korra: Turf Wars!</p>

                <p>"Korra Alone" is the second episode of Book Four: Balance of The Legend of Korra and the 41st of the overall series. It was released online on Nick.com and through the Nick app on October 10, 2014, and aired on Nicktoons Network on November 28, 2014.

As Korra is haunted by a shadow of herself in the Avatar State, she reminisces about the hardships she has endured the past three years. In 171 AG, after being poisoned by the Red Lotus, she retreated to the Southern Water Tribe in an attempt to heal her body and her mind. Although she was able to recover physically after two years with Katara's help, Korra continued to have visions about Zaheer and the attempt on her life. In 173 AG, she set out on a journey across the world in an unsuccessful attempt to reconnect with Raava. In the present, 174 AG, while wandering through a small Earth Kingdom town, she decides to confront the vision of herself in a duel and loses. When a small dog begs her to follow it, she finds herself in the Foggy Swamp. After another confrontation with her Avatar self, she passes out and wakes up in the home of Toph.</p>
